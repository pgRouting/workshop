"OpenLayers 3 is a complete rewrite of OpenLayers 2, it uses modern "

"The new code is based on the `Google Closure Tools "
"<https://developers.google.com/closure/>`_, this allows us to use a "
"comprehensive and well-tested library (the Closure Library, also used to "
"build Gmail, Google Maps and most of the Google web applications). But the "
"most powerful tool is the Closure Compiler; a java based compiler who can "
"remove dead code, optimize and minimize javascript. These tools are "
"completely optional for the OpenLayers library users: they only need to "
"download the compiled code and use it, that's what we will do now."
