"Many pgRouting functions provide a \"low-level\" interface to algorithms and"
" for example return ordered ID's rather than routes with geometries. "
"\"Wrapper functions\" therefor offer different input parameters as well as "
"transform the returned result into a format, that can be easier read or "
"consumed by applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/wrapper.rst:17
msgid ""
"The downside of wrapper functions is, that they often make assumptions that "
"make them only useful for specific use cases or network data. Therefor "
"pgRouting has decided to only support low-level functions and let the user "
"write their own wrapper functions for their own use cases."
