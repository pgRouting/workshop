"As explained in the :ref:`chapter about routing algorithms <routing>` a "
"shortest path query usualy looks like this:"

#: ../../chapters/advanced.rst:33
msgid ""
"This is usually called **shortest** path, which means that a length of an "
"edge is its cost. But cost doesn't need to be length, cost can be almost "
"anything, for example time, slope, surface, road type, etc.. Or it can be a "
"combination of multiple parameters (\"Weighted costs\")."

"In \"real\" networks there are different limitations or preferences for "
"different road types for example. In other words, we don't want to get the "
"*shortest* but the **cheapest** path - a path with a minimal cost. There is "
"no limitation in what we take as costs."

"For better performance, especially if the network data is large, it is "

"Through subqueries you can \"mix\" your costs as you like and this will "
