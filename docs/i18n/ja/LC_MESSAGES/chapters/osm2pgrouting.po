"**osm2pgrouting** is a command line tool that allows to import OpenStreetMap"
" data into a pgRouting database. It builds the routing network topology "
"automatically and creates tables for feature types and road classes. "
"osm2pgrouting was primarily written by Daniel Wendt and is currently hosted "
"on the pgRouting project site: "
"http://www.pgrouting.org/docs/tools/osm2pgrouting.html"

"There are some limitations, especially regarding the network size. The "
"current version of osm2pgrouting needs to load all data into memory, which "
"makes it fast but also requires a lot or memory for large datasets. An "
"alternative tool to osm2pgrouting without the network size limitation is "
"**osm2po** (http://osm2po.de). It's available under \"Freeware License\"."
