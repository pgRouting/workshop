The result is represented as an image by the WMS server and returned to our application and displayed."

msgid "The new code is based on the `Google Closure Tools <https://developers.google.com/closure/>`_, this allows us to use a comprehensive and well-tested library (the Closure Library, also used to build Gmail, Google Maps and most of the Google web applications). But the most powerful tool is the Closure Compiler; a java based compiler who can remove dead code, optimize and minimize javascript. These tools are completely optional for the OpenLayers library users: they only need to download the compiled code and use it, that's what we will do now."
