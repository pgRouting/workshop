msgid ":doc:`osm2pgrouting <osm2pgrouting>` is a convenient tool, but it's also a *black box*. There are several cases where :doc:`osm2pgrouting <osm2pgrouting>` can't be used. Obviously if the data isn't OpenStreetMap data. Some network data already comes with a network topology that can be used with pgRouting out-of-the-box. Often network data is stored in Shape file format (``.shp``) and we can use PostGIS' ``shape2postgresql`` converter to import the data into a PostgreSQL database. But what to do then?"
