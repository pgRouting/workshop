Achieving SDGs with pgRouting: A Unique Perspective
****************************************************


History
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `UN OpenGIS initiative <http://unopengis.org/unopengis/main/main.php>`__
along with `OSGeo Foundation <https://www.osgeo.org/>`__ organized the `OSGeo
UN Committee Educational Challenge
<https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/2021-osgeo-un-committee-educational-challenge>`__
where Challenge 2 was to create Workshop material for pgRouting. The challenge
supports the objectives of the OSGeo UN Committee, i.e. promoting the
development and use of open-source software that meets UN needs and supports
the aims of the UN. pgRouting is not only useful for routing cars on roads but
it can also be used to analyse water distribution networks, river flow or the
connectivity of an electricity network. Currently, this workshop expands the
pgRouting workshop  by addressing three of the seventeen SDGs
