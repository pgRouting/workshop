Achieving SDGs with pgRouting : A Unique Perspective
****************************************************


The following educational material has been drafted within the framework of the **OSGeo UN Committee Educational Challenge** (Challenge 2: Workshop material for pgRouting). The learning objectives of this challenge are to learn how pgRouting can be used to achieve UN SDGs, have a broader view on pgRouting applications other than “routing cars or vehicles” and have a more deeper understanding of working with geospatial data using pgRouting. In that respect, pgRouting queries are employed to solve the problems focussin gon three sustainable development goals. Further sections will explainin further about the UN SDGs.

We have prepared this educational material for researchers, educators and professionals in local, regional, national or international agencies who have some knowledge of PostGIS and PostgreSQL, and want to teach themselves how to use pgRouting. We assume our audience  has introductory knowledge of database management systems and geospatial data structures and formats.

Prerequisite knowledge 
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Workshop level: intermediate
* Attendee’s previous knowledge: SQL (PostgreSQL, PostGIS), a brief idea about applications of GIS and pgRouting

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 interconnected goals which were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to all the nations to take action to end poverty, hunger protect the planet from the over exploitation by global cooperation. UN aims to achieve th goals by to ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
