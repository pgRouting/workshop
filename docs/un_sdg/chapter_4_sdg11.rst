UN SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
###############################################################################

SDG 11 aspires to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.The
world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, more than half the worldâ€™s
population has been living in cities. This makes it very important for the cities
to remain alert when there is a chance of disaster like floods. Local 
administration should know if their city is goiung to get affected by the rains
which happen in their proximity. This excercise will solve one of such problems.
