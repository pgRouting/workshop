UN SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
###############################################################################

SDG 11 aspires to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.The
world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, more than half the worldâ€™s
population has been living in cities. This makes it very important for the cities
to remain alert when there is a chance of disaster like floods. Local 
administration should know if their city is goiung to get affected by the rains
which happen in their proximity. This excercise will solve one of such problems.

Excercise 4.1: City getting affected by rain or not
================================================================================

**Problem Statement**

* To determine the areas where if it rains will affect a city/town

**Core Idea** 

* If it rains in vicinity of a river connecting the city, the city will get 
  affected by the rains.

**Approach**

* Choose a city
* Get the Rivers (Edges) and Cities(Points) 
* Create river components
* Create a Buffer function to get an intersection with the river components




First step is to pre-process the data obtained from Chapter-4. The sub heads from
`Setting the Search Path` to `Process to get Connected Components of Waterways` 
explain the pre-processing steps.

Setting the Search Path of Waterways
...............................................................................
First step in pre processing is to set the search path for our downloaded data.
Search path is a list of schemas helps the system determine how a particular table 
is to be imported. In this case, search path of waterways table is set to `waterways` 
schema ans `waterways.xml` configuration file as we say in Chapter 2.3. `\dn` is 
used to list down all the present schemas. `SHOW search_path` command shows the 
current search path. `SET search_path` is used to set the serach path to `Waterways`. 
Finally, `\dt` is used to verify if the the Schema have bees changed correctly

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: \o setting_search_path.txt 
    :end-before:  \o count_waterways.txt
    :linenos:


Counting the number of Waterways
...............................................................................
Counting the number of edges present in the gives the information if the amount 
of data. Also, some of the rows can be seen to  understand the sructure of the 
table and how the data is stored in it.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: \o count_waterways.txt
    :end-before:  \o connected_components.txt
    :linenos:
 
Removing the Rivers which are not on land
...............................................................................
This exercise focusses only the areas on land, where if it rains the city is 
affected. Hence the rivers which are there in the swamp area have to be removed
from the `waterways_ways` table.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: -- remove rivers on the swamp area (we want the rivers which are only on land)
    :end-before:  -- Update the vertices with the component number
    :language: sql 
    :linenos:
 
Choose a city
...............................................................................
For this exercise, Munshigang city from Bangladesh is chosen. This city has multiple 
rivers in its proximity which makes it an apt location to demonstrate this excercise. 
The exercise will try to find the areas, where if it rains the city will be affected.
To define the location of this city and use it in for futher steps, create a table to
store the name along with lattiude amd longitude values of City's location. This stores
the city as a point.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: -- Create a city
    :end-before:  \o creating_buffers_city.txt
    :language: sql 
    :linenos:

Lattiude amd longitude values are converted into `geometry` form using ST_Point 
whichreturns a point with the given X and Y coordinate values. ST_SetSRID is used 
to set the SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier) on the point geometry to 4326.
    
Process to get Connected Components of Waterways
...............................................................................
As the rivers in the data are not having single edge, i.e, multiple edges make up 
a river, it is important to find out the connected edges and store the information
in the `waterways_ways` table. This will help us to identify which edges belong to
a river. First, the connected components are found and then stored in a new column 
named `component`. 

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: -- Add a column for storing the component
    :end-before:  -- remove rivers on the swamp area (we want the rivers which are only on land)
    :language: sql 
    :linenos:

pgRouting function `pgr_connectedComponents` is used to complete this task.
A sub-query is created to find out all the connected components. After that,
the `component` column is updated using the results obtained from the subquery.
This helps in storing the component id in the `waterways_ways_vertices_pgr` table.
Next query uses this output and stores the component id in the the waterways_ways
(edges) table.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: -- Update the vertices with the component number
    :end-before:  -- Create a city
    :language: sql 
    :linenos:

With component id stored in both vertex and edge table of waterways, lets proceed 
to next step.

Create a Buffer around city
...............................................................................
Create a buffer around the city to define an area, inside which the intersection 
of rivers would be found. `ST_Buffer` is used to create this buffer.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after:  -- Creating buffers for city
    :end-before:   -- Creating a function that gets the city_buffer
    :linenos:

A function can be created for the same task. this will be helpfun when the table 
has more than one city.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after:  -- Creating a function that gets the city_buffer
    :end-before:   Intersecting_components.txt
    :linenos:

Finding the components intersecting the buffer
...............................................................................
Next ste is to find the components of waterways which lie in the buffer zone of 
the city. These are the waterways which will affect the city when it rains around 
them. This is done using `ST_Intersects`.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: -- Intersection of City Buffer and River Components
    :end-before:  \o creating_rain_zones_buffers_waterways.txt
    :linenos:
    
Output shows the distinct component numbers which lie in the buffer zone of the city.
Next step is to get all the edges that have those components.

Create a Buffer function to get an intersection with the river components
...............................................................................
This is the final step of the exercise. In this, the area where if it rains, the 
city would be affected, also can be called as `rain zone` is being found. 
First, add columns named `rain_zone` in waterways_ways to store buffer geometry
of the rain zones. Then, find the buffer for every edge which intersects the buffer
area using ST_Buffer and update the `rain_zone` column.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: -- Buffer of River Components
    :end-before:  -- Combining mutliple rain zones       
    :linenos:

This will give us the requires area, where if it rains, the city will be affected. 
Multiple polygons that are obtained can also be merged using ST_Union. This will give
a single polygon as the output.

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/un_sdg/sdg11/all_exercises_sdg11.sql
    :start-after: -- Combining mutliple rain zones
    :end-before:  \o       
    :linenos:
