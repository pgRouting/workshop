":doc:`osm2pgrouting <../appendix/appendix-3>` is a convenient tool, and "
"its focus to work on OpenStreetMap data. There are several cases where "
":doc:`osm2pgrouting <../appendix/appendix-3>` can't be used. Some network"
" data already comes with a network topology that can be used with "
"pgRouting out-of-the-box. Often network data is stored in Shape file "
"format (``.shp``) and we can use PostGIS' ``shp2pgsql`` converter to "
"import the data into a PostgreSQL database."
