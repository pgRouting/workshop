"|pgrouting-web| adds routing functionality to |postgis-web|. This "
"introductory workshop will demonstrate the routing functionality by "
"providing practical examples using |osm-web| road network data. It will "
"be covering topics starting from preparing the data, making routing "
"queries, writing custom 'plpgsql' functions up to integrating pgRouting "
"with other FOSS4G tools."
