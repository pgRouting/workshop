"The goal of this chapter is to create a simple web-based user interface "
"to pgRouting based on OpenLayers. The user will be able to choose start "
"and destination locations, and get the route from the start point to the "
"destination point."

msgid ""
"The start and destination points are created by the user, with simple "
"clicks on the map. The start and destination coordinates are then sent to"
" the WMS server (GeoServer), as parameters to a WMS ``GetMap`` request. "
"The resulting image is added as an *image* layer to the map."

"Creating an OpenLayers map in a web page involves creating a *map* "
"object, which is an instance of the ``ol.Map`` class. Then, data layers "

"The center and resolution (zoom level) of the map are controlled through "
"the *view* object. Unless other mapping libraries, the view is separated "
"from the map; one advantage is to allow multiple maps to share the same "
"view. See `this example "

"OpenLayers features three renderers: the *Canvas* renderer, the *WebGL* "
"renderer, and the *DOM* renderer. Currently, the most capable renderer is"
" Canvas. In particular the Canvas renderer supports vector layers, while "
"the other two don't. Canvas is the default renderer, and the renderer "
"used in this workshop."
