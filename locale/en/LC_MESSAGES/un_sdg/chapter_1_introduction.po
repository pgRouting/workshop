"The `UN OpenGIS initiative "
"<http://unopengis.org/unopengis/main/main.php>`__ along with `OSGeo "
"Foundation <https://www.osgeo.org/>`__ organized the `OSGeo UN Committee "
"Educational Challenge <https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/2021-osgeo-"
"un-committee-educational-challenge>`__ where Challenge 2 was to create "
"Workshop material for pgRouting. The challenge supports the objectives of"
" the OSGeo UN Committee, i.e. promoting the development and use of open-"
"source software that meets UN needs and supports the aims of the UN. "
"pgRouting is not only useful for routing cars on roads but it can also be"
" used to analyse water distribution networks, river flow or the "
"connectivity of an electricity network. Currently, this workshop expands "
"the pgRouting workshop  by addressing three of the seventeen SDGs"
