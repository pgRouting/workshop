"sustainable.The world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, "
"more than half the world’s population has been living in cities. This "
"makes it very important for the cities to remain alert when there is a "
"chance of disaster like floods. Local administration should know if their"
" city is goiung to get affected by the rains which happen in their "
"proximity. This excercise will solve one of such problems."
