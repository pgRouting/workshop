"`Sustainable Cities and Communities` is the 11th Sustainable Development "
"Goal which aspires to make cities `inclusive, safe, resilient` and "
"`sustainable`.The world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, "
"more than half the world’s population has been living in cities. This "
"makes it very important for the cities to remain alert when there is a "
"chance of disaster like floods. Local administration should know if their"
" city is going to get affected by the rains which happen in their "
"proximity so that they can raise an alert amongst the citizens. This "
"exercise will solve one of such problems."
