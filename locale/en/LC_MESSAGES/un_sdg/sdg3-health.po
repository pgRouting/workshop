"`Good Health and Well Being` is the 3rd Sustainable Development Goal "
"which aspires to ensure health and well-being for all, including a bold "
"commitment to end the epidemics like AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and "
"other communicable diseases by 2030. It also aims to achieve universal "
"health coverage, and provide access to safe and effective medicines and "
"vaccines for all. Supporting research and development for vaccines is an "
"essential part of this process as well as expanding access to affordable "
"medicines. Hospitals are a very important part of a well functioning "
"health infrastructure. An appropriate planning is required for optimal "
"distribution of the population of an area to its hospitals. Hence, it is "
"very important to estimate the number of dependant people living near the"
" hospital for better planning which would ultimately help in achieving "
"universal coverage of health services. This chapter will focus on solving"
" one such problem."
