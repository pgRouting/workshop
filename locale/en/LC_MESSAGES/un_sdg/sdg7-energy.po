"`Affordable and Clean Energy` is the 7th Sustainable Development Goal 11."
" It aspires to ensure access to `affordable, reliable, sustainable` and "
"`modern` energy for all. Today renewable energy is making impressive "
"gains in the electricity sector. As more and more new settlements are "
"built, there would be new electricity distribution network developed. "
"Electricity Distribution is very expensive infrastructure. Finding the "
"optimal path for laying this infrastructure is very crucial to maintain "
"the affordability of electricity for everyone. This exercise focusses on "
"finding this optimal path/network for laying the electricity distribution"
