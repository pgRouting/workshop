"|pgrouting-web| adds routing functionality to |postgis-web|. This "
"introductory workshop will demonstrate the routing functionality by "
"providing practical examples using |osm-web| road network data. It will be "
"covering topics starting from preparing the data, making routing queries, "
"writing custom 'plpgsql' functions up to integrating pgRouting with other "
"FOSS4G tools."
