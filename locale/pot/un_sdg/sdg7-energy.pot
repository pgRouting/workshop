msgid "`Affordable and Clean Energy` is the 7th Sustainable Development Goal 11. It aspires to ensure access to `affordable, reliable, sustainable` and `modern` energy for all. Today renewable energy is making impressive gains in the electricity sector. As more and more new settlements are built, there would be new electricity distribution network developed. Electricity Distribution is very expensive infrastructure. Finding the optimal path for laying this infrastructure is very crucial to maintain the affordability of electricity for everyone. This exercise focusses on finding this optimal path/network for laying the electricity distribution equipment."

This is a very important step to make sure that the data is of required quality. pgRouting can also be used to do some Data Adjustments. This will be discussed in further sections."
